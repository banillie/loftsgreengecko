                <p>
                    Alex and Anik McCarthy were already feeling nervous about getting more work done on their coastal
                    home near Brighton – they’d been burnt once before by bad builders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a growing family, and their youngest squeezed into a boxroom, they were desperate for extra
                    space.
                </p>

                <p class="funky-quote">❝The last-minute cancellation❞</p>
                <p>
                    So it was a huge blow when the company booked in to carry out a loft extension pulled out at the
                    last minute. Then in stepped Green Gecko.

                {#                <p class="funky-quote">❝This was stress-free❞</p>#}

                <p>
                    Mick and Ese came with years of experience in the industry, slightly under the previous quote – and
                    ready to get stuck in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was a completely different experience this time round, says Alex.
                </p>

                <p class="funky-quote">
                    ❝This was stress-free and they were super-reliable. When they said they would be somewhere or do
                    something – they did it.❞
                </p>

                <p>
                    They also swept up and packed away their tools every day.
                </p>

                {#                <p class="funky-quote">❝Everyone’s happy❞</p>#}

                <p>
                    The full-width dormer extension has allowed the McCarthys’ home to grow alongside their family. And
                    they’re delighted.
                </p>

                <p class="funky-quote">
                    ❝We’re happy in the loft - we’ve got an en suite, a nice airy bedroom and my wife’s got the walk-in
                    wardrobe that she’d always wanted,❞ says Alex.
                </p>

                <p class="funky-quote">
                    ❝The kids love it too. They’ve got more rooms for hide and seek.❞
                </p>

                <p>
                    And friends and family have been amazed by the transformation and the high-quality finish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While the family have no plans to sell their Woodingdean home any time soon, they can feel reassured
                    it’s worth a lot more now.
